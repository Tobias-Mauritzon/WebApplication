Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue Examples 
--------------------------------------------------

This README file describes the different categories of 
JMS2.0 examples found in the directories listed below.

This README also describes how to configure your 
environment and explains how CLASSPATH should be set
to run the Java examples.

Each individual directory has README which has more details on how to run the samples.

Samples under the below directories are explicitly using new com.sun.messaging.ConnectionFactory() to get the connectionfactory object.
Applications are recommended to obtain the connection factory by doing a JNDI lookup.


Directory     		Description
---------     		-----------
asyncsend    		Contains sample programs that demonstrate the 
              		use of new async send JMS2.0 feature with Message Queue.

asynctopicconsumer      Contains sample programs that demonstrate the
                        use of new JMS2.0 simplified API to send and 
			asynchrously receive messages.

deliverycount           Contains sample programs that demonstrate the
                        use of new JMS2.0 message property JMSXDeliveryCount 
                        with Message Queue.

deliverydelay           Contains sample programs that demonstrate the 
			use of new JMS2.0 setDeliveryDelay & getDeliveryDelay 
			apis with Message Queue.

messagegetbody          Contains sample programs that demonstrate the
			use of new JMS2.0 getBody api with Message Queue.

messageheader  		Contains sample programs that demonstrate the
			use of new jms2.0 simplified api to set message
			header properties on producer.

messageproperties       Contains sample programs that demonstrate the
                        use of new jms2.0 simplified api to set message
                        properties on producer.

selector                Contains sample programs that demonstrate the
                        use of new jms2.0 simplified api to create a 
                        message selector on a non-durable topic subscription.

syncqueue   		Contains sample programs that demonstrate the
                        use of new JMS2.0 simplified API to send and 
			synchronously receive messages.

sharedsub               Contains sample programs that demonstrate the
                        use of new JMS2.0 simplified API to create shared 
                        consumers and sharing of messages between them.

Configuring the Environment For the Java Examples
-------------------------------------------------

You should install Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue and start the 
broker (imqbrokerd) before attempting to compile and/or run the example
applications.  imqbrokerd is located in the <IMQ_HOME>/bin directory.

The Message Queue examples are found under the <IMQ_HOME>/examples
directory.  If you installed SVR4 packages, the examples are under
/usr/demo/imq.  If you installed RPMs, the examples are under
/opt/sun/mq/examples.

IMQ_HOME
--------
IMQ_HOME denotes the directory <mqInstallHome>/mq where
mqInstallHome is specified when you install the product.

CLASSPATH
---------
The Java examples have already been compiled using JDK1.7.

To recompile or run the examples with JDK1.7, you will need to ensure
that the following jar files are in your CLASSPATH -
    jms.jar
    imq.jar
    directory containing this example

On SJSMQ/OpenMQ (all platforms):
    set CLASSPATH to <IMQ_HOME>/lib/jms.jar:<IMQ_HOME>/lib/imq.jar:.

On Solaris with SVR4 Packages:
    set CLASSPATH to /usr/share/lib/jms.jar:/usr/share/lib/imq.jar:.

On Linux with RH RPMs:
    set CLASSPATH to /opt/sun/mq/share/lib/jms.jar:/opt/sun/mq/share/lib/imq.jar:.

For running a client application that uses JNDI with File System
Provider, fscontext.jar should be added to the CLASSPATH.

Additional CLASSPATH requirements (if any) are noted with the
description of each example.
