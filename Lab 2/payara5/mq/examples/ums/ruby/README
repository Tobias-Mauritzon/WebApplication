SendMsg.rb and ReceiveMsg.rb require Ruby 1.8.6 or later version.
A compatible Ruby interpreter such as JRuby 1.1.5 can also be used.

The examples above assume that the Context Root for the UMS web module
is '/ums'. If this is not the case, please modify the DEFAULT_CONTEXT_ROOT
variable in the application accordingly.

The examples can be run using the ruby command, e.g.

    ruby <application> -h

    or

    jruby <application> -h

For example,

    ruby SendMsg.rb -h

    or

    jruby SendMsg.rb -h
