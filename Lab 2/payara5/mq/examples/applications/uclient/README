UniversalClient example

Description
-----------
The UniversalClient example is a basic 'client' application that uses the JMS 1.1 APIs.
It uses JMS Message Producer and Consumer to send and receive messages.
UniversalClient.java does not use JNDI and relies on
the feature by which a broker can "auto-create" the destinations 
desired by the user. The bulk of the application deals with the 
user interface and the JMS related code is fairly straightforward.
