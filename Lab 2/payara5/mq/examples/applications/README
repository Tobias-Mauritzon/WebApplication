Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue Examples: Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains more sophisticated JMS example programs.

Directory     Description
---------     -----------
qbrowser      A GUI application that uses the Message Queue JMS 
              monitoring API to get the list of queues from a Message
	      Queue broker, and browser their contents using a JMS 
	      QueueBrowser.

simplechat    A GUI application that uses the JMS API to implement
              a simple chat application.

mqapplet      A browser based Java applet that uses the JMS API to
              implement a simple chat application.

mqping	      A utility similar to the Unix ping utility in some regards.  
	      With mqping, messages are sent to and received from a running 
	      broker.  The utility measures the round trip time.  The 
	      utility allows the user to control the size of the message, 
	      the destination type, delivery mode and send interval.

uclient       A basic 'client' application that uses the JMS 1.1 APIs.
	      It uses JMS Message Producer and Consumer to send and receive 
	      messages.  It .java does not use JNDI and relies on
	      the feature by which a broker can "auto-create" the destinations 
	      desired by the user. The bulk of the application deals with the 
	      user interface and the JMS related code is fairly straightforward.
