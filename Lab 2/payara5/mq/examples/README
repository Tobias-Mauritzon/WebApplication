Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue Examples 
--------------------------------------------------

This README file describes the different categories of 
Message Queue examples found in the directories listed below.

This README also describes how to configure your 
environment and explains how CLASSPATH should be set
to run the Java examples.


Directory     Description
---------     -----------
helloworld    Contains simple programs that show how
              a JMS client is created and deployed in 
	      Message Queue. These examples are closely 
	      tied to the tutorials in the documentation.

	      In addition to showing how to send and
	      receive messages, these examples also
              demonstrate all the steps necessary to 
	      create administered objects in Message Queue, 
	      as well as how to use JNDI in the client to lookup 
	      and use those administered objects.


jms           Contains sample programs that demonstrate the
              use of the JMS API with Message Queue.

jms20         Contains sample programs that demonstrate the
              use of the new JMS2.0 API with Message Queue.

C             Contains sample programs that demonstrate how to
              create C language clients that use the Message Queue 
	      C API. This directory is only installed with the
              Enterprise Edition of Message Queue.

              Note that on Solaris with SVR4 packages this category 
              is found in /opt/SUNWimq/demo/C - which is a different
              from the location of the examples included
              with the Platform Edition of Message Queue.


jaxm          Contains sample programs that demonstrate how to
              use SOAP messages in conjunction with JMS in Message 
              Queue.


applications  This directory contains sub directories, each
              with more elaborate sample applications, that
              can be used with Message Queue. 


monitoring    Contains sample programs that demonstrate how to
              use the JMS API for monitoring the broker.


imqobjmgr     Contains examples of imqobjmgr command files that
              demonstrate the basic features of the imqobjmgr
              tool.


jdbc          Contains configuration properties for various
              databases that can be plugged in for broker
              persistence.


jmx           Contains sample programs that demonstrate how to
	      use the broker JMX Management and Monitoring API.


ums           Contains sample programs that demonstrate how to
	      use the UMS API.


stomp         Contains sample programs that demonstrate how to
	      use the STOMP protocol to send and receive messages.

jmsbridge     Contains a sample of the use of JMS Bridge.

jaas          Contains a README explaining how to plug in the 
	      SampleLoginModule from the JAAS Authentication 
  	      Tutorial to MQ broker.

Configuring the Environment For the Java Examples
-------------------------------------------------

You should install Oracle GlassFish(tm) Server Message Queue and start the 
broker (imqbrokerd) before attempting to compile and/or run the example
applications.  imqbrokerd is located in the <IMQ_HOME>/bin directory.

The Message Queue examples are found under the <IMQ_HOME>/examples
directory.  If you installed SVR4 packages, the examples are under
/usr/demo/imq.  If you installed RPMs, the examples are under
/opt/sun/mq/examples.

IMQ_HOME
--------
IMQ_HOME denotes the directory <mqInstallHome>/mq where
mqInstallHome is specified when you install the product.

CLASSPATH
---------
The Java examples have already been compiled using JDK1.7.x.

To recompile or run the examples with JDK1.7.x, you will need to ensure
that the following jar files are in your CLASSPATH -
    jms.jar
    imq.jar
    directory containing this example

On SJSMQ/OpenMQ (all platforms):
    set CLASSPATH to <IMQ_HOME>/lib/jms.jar:<IMQ_HOME>/lib/imq.jar:.

On Solaris with SVR4 Packages:
    set CLASSPATH to /usr/share/lib/jms.jar:/usr/share/lib/imq.jar:.

On Linux with RH RPMs:
    set CLASSPATH to /opt/sun/mq/share/lib/jms.jar:/opt/sun/mq/share/lib/imq.jar:.

For running a client application that uses JNDI with File System
Provider, fscontext.jar should be added to the CLASSPATH.

Additional CLASSPATH requirements (if any) are noted with the
description of each example.
