To plug in a database for broker persistence, a set of properties needs to
be specified in the broker's instance property file.  This directory contains
examples for plugging in a Java DB (Derby) database, PointBase database,
MySQL database, DB2 database and an Oracle database.
These properties are also documented in the generated instance configuration
properties file.
