/**
 * The MessageConversion class consists only of a main method, which creates 
 * and then reads a StreamMessage and a BytesMessage.  It does not send the 
 * messages.
 * <p>
 * The program demonstrates type conversions in StreamMessages:  you can write
 * data as a String and read it as an Int, and vice versa.  The program also
 * calls clearBody() to clear the message so that it can be rewritten.
 * <p>
 * The program also shows how to write and read a BytesMessage using data types
 * other than a byte array.  Conversion between String and other types is
 * not supported.
 * <p>
 * Before it can read a BytesMessage or StreamMessage that has not been sent,
 * the program must call reset() to put the message body in read-only mode 
 * and reposition the stream.
